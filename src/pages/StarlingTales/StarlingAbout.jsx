              We believe in the quiet magic of simple pleasures — because it is
              often the little things that mean the most. At Starling Tales, we
              find inspiration in those precious, uncomplicated moments of
              happiness. A soft giggle, a sleepy cuddle, a story whispered at
              bedtime. It is with these moments in mind that we create
              collections designed to be lived in, loved, and to become an
              intimate part of your everyday life.

              We believe childhood should feel gentle, comforting, and
              beautifully unhurried. Our world is one of serene wonder — where
              beautiful, stylish design meets mindful materials that feel like a
              soft, warm hug. We are guided by three unwavering promises:
              Timeless Style, Uncompromising Quality, and Exceptional Attention
              to Detail.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-5 text-[12px] font-light leading-[1.85] text-text-body">
              Every Starling Tales piece is thoughtfully created using
              chemical-free fibres, soothing tones, and understated accents.
              Wonderfully durable, easy to care for, and made to last, every
              stitch is placed with intention. We are obsessive about detail,
              and proudly so. The way our toys sit perfectly in little hands,
              the expression that speaks a thousand words, the comfort of
              holding one close — it is pure magic.

              We don’t just make toys and nursery textiles. We create companions
              that celebrate childhood milestones and become cherished
              heirlooms, bringing a gentle and enduring sense of comfort,
              imagination, and peace into your home. Made to be cherished, as
              much as we cherish creating them.
